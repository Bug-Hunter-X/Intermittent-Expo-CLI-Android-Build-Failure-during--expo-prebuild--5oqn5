# Intermittent Expo CLI Android Build Failure

This repository demonstrates an issue where the Expo CLI's Android build process fails intermittently during the `expo prebuild` step. The failure is inconsistent, meaning the build sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails without any apparent changes to the code or project configuration.

## Problem
The build process fails with an error indicating that certain assets are missing or the build directory is incomplete. The exact error message can vary, making it difficult to pinpoint the cause.

## Potential Causes
The root cause is still under investigation, but some potential factors include:
* **Caching issues:** Problems with Expo's internal caching mechanisms might lead to incomplete or corrupt asset copies.
* **Platform inconsistencies:**  Differences in build environments or Android SDK versions might introduce inconsistencies.
* **Race conditions:** Concurrent operations during the build process could result in unexpected errors.

## Solution (Partial)
The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a workaround that involves cleaning the build cache and performing a fresh build.  While this is not a guaranteed solution, it has proven effective in some cases.  Further investigation is needed for a complete fix.  See the `bugSolution.js` for details.
