This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  It happens during the `expo prebuild` step and manifests as a seemingly random failure to copy necessary assets into the Android project. The exact error message might vary, but it often involves a missing file or an incomplete build directory. The problem is inconsistent; sometimes the build succeeds, other times it fails without apparent changes to the code or configuration.
